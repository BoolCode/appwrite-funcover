# Appwrite Funcover

> Right before Appwrite's [releasing](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/discussions/5016) the next generation (4) of their functions, You can cover your Appwrite function with a dedicated endpoint!

With Funcover you can `cover` your function with any domain you want!

That means that you'll be able to access one of your [Appwrite functions](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions)  or all of them using any endpoint you want.

This feature will help you use Appwrite functions as a target-webhook, direct access URL (without the need to provide project id), And also simply, for your convince.

## üí• Funcover is built with:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) _(Because I like it)_ - A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - Simple, ultrafast web framework.
- TypeScript - I'm speechless :wink:

## üßë‚Äçüíª Installation

Funcover meant to be added to your current [self-hosted](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting) Appwrite instance, and, this is what we going to cover in this page.
However, you can use Funcover as a standalone Appwrite-Function proxy, and use some provider - Cloudflare, for example - to handle the SSL part for you.

#### üîí SSL

_If you're going to use Funcover in a Path Based mode you can skip this part._

Before adding Funcover you'll need make sure that the domain you're planning to use will have SSL, To do so we're harnessing Appwrite [custom-domain](https://appwrite.io/docs/custom-domains) feature.

After adding your domain as custom-domain to any of your Appwrite project, and, the domain is now pointing to your Appwrite instance you can move to the next step.

#### üåê Adding Funcover - Domain Based

In **Domain Based** mode we want to be able to access Funcover using a completely different domain.

SSH into your server and edit your `docker-compose.yml` file.

At the bottom of the file right after the `telegraf` service, and, right before the `networks` section add the following.

```yaml
  funcover:
    image: boolcode/appwrite-funcover:0.0.7
    container_name: funcover
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - ALLOW_GLOBAL=true
      - DEFAULT_PROJECT=yourDefaultProjectID
      - DEFAULT_FUNCTION=yourDefaultFunctionID
    networks:
      - appwrite
      - gateway
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.constraint-label-stack=appwrite
      - traefik.docker.network=appwrite
      - traefik.http.services.funcover.loadbalancer.server.port=3000
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-http.entrypoints=appwrite_web
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-http.rule=Host(`custom.domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-http.service=funcover
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.entrypoints=appwrite_websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.rule=Host(`custom.domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.service=funcover
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.tls=true
```

Replace `custom.domain.com` with your newly attached custom-domain.

Look [here](docker-compose.yml) for a complete example.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Adding Funcover - Path Based

In **Path Based** mode we want to be able to access Funcover with current Appwrite domain, But, with a custom path.

_Added in version `0.0.6`_

```yaml
  funcover:
    image: boolcode/appwrite-funcover:0.0.7
    container_name: funcover
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - ALLOW_GLOBAL=true
      - DEFAULT_PROJECT=yourDefaultProjectID
      - DEFAULT_FUNCTION=yourDefaultFunctionID
    networks:
      - appwrite
      - gateway
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.constraint-label-stack=appwrite
      - traefik.docker.network=appwrite
      - traefik.http.services.funcover.loadbalancer.server.port=3000
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-http.entrypoints=appwrite_web
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-http.rule=PathPrefix(`/v1/webhook`)
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-http.service=funcover
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.entrypoints=appwrite_websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.rule=PathPrefix(`/v1/webhook`)
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.service=funcover
      - traefik.http.routers.funcover-https.tls=true
```

Keep in mind that you'll need to add `PATH_INSTEAD_OF_DOMAIN` and `PATH_PREFIX` environment variables. check more [here](#-environment-variables).

#### ü¶âÔ∏è Deep dive

<details>
<summary>What is going on that snippet, what we just did??</summary>

We have added a new service into the docker-compose.yml file, And, Here's a quick overview of the fields.

- `image` - The name of the Docker image we are using for this service.
- `container_name` - The name of the container. useful for logging and monitoring.
- `restart` - Container restart policy. We have set it to `unless-stopped`, So, unless we're stopping it Docker will make sure the service is on.
- `environment` - Here we're passing some values to be handled by Funcover at runtime. This is the best way to customize docker images without the need to rebuild them.
- `networks` - Here we're connecting Funcover to `appwrite` network.
- `labels` - Labels are piece of information that can be used by other containers,In this case the `traefik` one.

Do notice the service rule (for http & https)

```
.rule=Host(`custom.domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
```

We are setting two conditions for the rule.

1. **Host** - We want to match the host to access Funcover.
2. **PathPrefix** - Adding this part is important for the case we want Funcover to be able to parse all requests with no routes.

_**Be aware** that when you're upgrading Appwrite this addition will be erased._
</details>
<hr> 

Now it's time to reload our Docker Compose environment by running,

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usages

Now any time you'll access the custom-domain, your default function in your default project will run, And, Will return back the execution JSON. Just like you've used the [createExecution](https://appwrite.io/docs/client/functions?sdk=web-default#functionsCreateExecution) function.

```json
{
  "$id"         : "5e5ea5c16897e",
  "$createdAt"  : "2020-10-15T06:38:00.000+00:00",
  "$updatedAt"  : "2020-10-15T06:38:00.000+00:00",
  "$permissions": [
    "any"
  ],
  "functionId"  : "5e5ea6g16897e",
  "trigger"     : "http",
  "status"      : "processing",
  "statusCode"  : 0,
  "response"    : "",
  "stdout"      : "",
  "stderr"      : "",
  "duration"    : 0.4
}
```

For different return formats check the `RETURN_TYPE` variable [here](#-environment-variables).

Passing data to the function can be done in any of the following four ways.

1. GET `data` variable. `https://custom.domain.com/?data=data`
2. GET parameter route as data. `https://custom.domain.com/data`
3. POST using raw data with `application/json` content type.
4. POST using form-data.
5. POST using application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

#### üóíÔ∏è Note for POST

Funcover will check first for raw JSON data before checking for `form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

Also, You can use a filed named `rawData` to pass data directly to `data` key. Here's an example in JSON

```json
{
  "rawData": "I'm piece of data"
}
```

This data will be sent to the function like so:

```json
{
  "data": "I'm piece of data"
}
```

As in any other case, this one for example:

```json
{
  "data": "I'm piece of data"
}
```

The data will be sent to the function completely, like so:

```json
{
  "data": "{\"data\":\"I'm piece of data\"}"
}
```

#### üìù Logs

Funcover don't produce any logs at runtime. In case you want to debug Funcover steps, or you just want to know more, You can pass the `VERBOSE` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Then you'll be able to see the logs by running

```shell
docker logs funcover
```

You can add the `-f` flag to follow the log output.

#### üåé Global

Funcover can be used for a single function by setting the `DEFAULT_PROJECT` & `DEFAULT_FUNCTION` variables.

Also, Funcover can be used to handle all of your functions by project and function ID.

To do so you'll need to set the `ALLOW_GLOBAL` variable as `true` and reload your Docker Compose environment.

Now you'll be able to access any of your functions by using the following route.

```
https://custom.domain.com/projectId/functionId/
```

Also, here, You pass the data in GET or POST as in the default function endpoint.

#### üé∂ Multiple instances.

In case you like to use Funcover on single mode, and/or you want to have multiple Funcover instances you can do so.

In the attached [example](docker-compose.yml) you can see how to set a second Funcover by looking on the `funcover-second` service.

#### üõë Rate limiting & Permissions

As of now Funcover uses the [REST](https://appwrite.io/docs/rest) [Client-side](https://appwrite.io/docs/sdks#client) SDK. That mean that each function will hit their client rate-limit after 60 execution in a given minute.

For most use-cases that will more than enough.

Also, because Funcover execute the function through Client-side, Make sure you're adding the `Any` execution permission for your function permissions.

If you want your function to run as many times as you like you can add project API key with the `API_KEYS` environment variable.

## üèóÔ∏è Environment variables

_You can take a look at [.env.example](.env.example) for possible values_

#### API Key variable usages

The format of this variable is like so:

```
API_KEYS=someProjectId:someProjectKey,anotherProjectId:anotherProjectKey
```

First add the project ID, then the full API key seperated with the `:` colons character.

Then, if you want to another API key for another project, you can do so by separating these project keys with a `,` comma.

______

#### Flatten headers Key variable usages

Like so:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "data"   : {},
    "headers": {}
  }
}
```

Notice your `data` will be sent recursively inside `data.data` property, and you'll to extract the data like so:

```javascript
// First, Get the payload.
const payload = JSON.parse(req.payload);

// Second, parse the data and the headers.
const data    = JSON.parse(payload.data);
const headers = JSON.parse(payload.headers);
```

______

#### Path as data variable usages

You don't need to use the `data` variable like this

```
https://custom.domain.com/?data=data
```

You can just send it as the following route like so:

```
https://custom.domain.com/data
```

This will also work with the `ALLOW_GLOBAL` variable, so you can use it like this:

```
https://custom.domain.com/projectId/functionId/data
```
